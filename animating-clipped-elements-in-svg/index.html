SVG can also be animated using various techniques. In combination with clipping paths, interesting effects can be achieved.</p><p>This article<strong>explains the difference between an SVG<code>clipPath</code>and a CSS<code>clip-path</code></strong>, including examples to guide and inform you through this journey. Finally, I’ll share a few demos both personal and in the wild to help you better understand<code>clipPath</code>animation and inspire your visions.</p><h3>Clipping Facts<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#clipping-facts">Link</a></h3><p>When only a portion of an object is visible through a bounding area, we call that a clipping mask. In other words, we get a clipping mask when a portion of a selected surface is “cut out,” making any objects that sit within the bounded region visible to the viewer. Any parts that lie outside of the region are invisible.</p><p>Think of a clipping path — CSS or SVG — as a custom viewport, like the porthole of a submarine. Clipping paths can also be considered a special type of mask,<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html#ClippingPaths">according to the W3C</a>’s “Clipping, Masking and Compositing” specification:</p><blockquote><p>The clipping path restricts the region to which paint can be applied. Conceptually, any parts of the drawing that lie outside of the region bounded by the currently active clipping path are not drawn. A clipping path can be thought of as a mask wherein those pixels outside the clipping path are black with an alpha value of zero and those pixels inside the clipping path are white with an alpha value of one (with the possible exception of anti-aliasing along the edge of the silhouette).</p></blockquote><p>If you’re curious how events transpire in an SVG with a<code>clipPath</code>, the following diagram depicts how an SVG<code>clipPath</code>is structured:</p><p>Clipped content requiring interaction, such as event-driven data, operates according to the “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html#clipPath-geometry">Clipping Paths, Geometry, and Pointer Events</a>” section of the specification:</p><blockquote><p>By default, pointer-events must not be dispatched on the clipped (non-visible) regions of a shape. For example, a circle with a radius of 10 which is clipped to a circle with a radius of 5 will not receive “click” events outside the smaller radius.</p></blockquote><h3>CSS Clip Path<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#css-clip-path">Link</a></h3><p>The difference between an<a href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/#elementdef-clippath">SVG<code>clipPath</code></a>and a<a href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/#the-clip-path">CSS<code>clip-path</code></a>is important. The latter defines a specific region of an element to display. This is all done within a style sheet.</p><p>The values in the bounding parentheses are read as “from top, from right, from bottom, from left.” These values define the clipping shape of the corresponding element.</p><p>Of course, we could implement far more intricate clipping patterns using a variety of shapes as our template. For instance, we could clip using an external SVG<code>clipPath</code>, referred to by a unique identifier (ID) or a polygon specified as a series of points.</p><p>If you want a visual guide, Bennett Feely has made a highly educational and interactive tool, called<a href="http://bennettfeely.com/clippy">Clippy</a>, that allows developers to explore different clipping shapes in the browser.</p><p>Below is a list of possible variations using the<code>clip-path</code>property in CSS. The first code block represents an SVG located inline with the markup and referred to via an external style sheet. Uncomment each variation to view the result of that approach.</p><h3>SVG Mask Vs. SVG clipPath<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#svg-mask-vs-svg-clippath">Link</a></h3><p>Just so we don’t confuse an SVG<code>mask</code>with an SVG<code>clipPath</code>, let’s examine what an SVG<code>mask</code>is and how it differs from a<code>clipPath</code>. I like to think of masks as a way to accept the visible region already defined by an object’s shape — as if you were to cover an object with a blanket and define the visible region by the object’s shape pressed into this blanket — whereas a clipping path defines the<em>shape</em>, not the object. In the latter case, the object would be covered with a blanket, with the visible region already defined, instead of the visible region being inherited from the object. An SVG mask is<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html#Masking">defined in the specification</a>as follows:</p><blockquote><p>A “mask” can contain any graphical elements or container elements such as a “g.” […]</p><p>Any graphical object which uses/references the given “mask” element will be painted onto the background through the mask, thus completely or partially masking out parts of the graphical object.</p></blockquote><p>If you’re still pondering what a mask looks like and the mechanics thereof, let’s start with the XML tag:</p><p>The<code>mask</code>element accepts quite a few attributes that take some getting used to, such as<code>maskUnits</code>. If you’re curious about the attributes, refer to the<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html#Masking">specification</a>.</p><p>Much like a<code>clipPath</code>, a<code>mask</code>may be reused multiple times, as long as it has been defined in the definitions,<code>defs</code>.</p><p>As the specification states, “A mask can accept a graphical object.” In this case, a rectangle meets this requirement. The mask’s rectangle has also been filled with a linear gradient.</p><p>The final steps are to reference this mask using the<code>mask</code>attribute and to pass the ID of<code>mask</code>within<code>defs</code>to the attribute’s<code>url()</code>method, which retrieves this<code>mask</code>with the corresponding ID. The<code>use</code>element allows for portability, which might be familiar to those of you who use SVG icon sprites.</p><p>There are some really crafty ways to animate linear gradients in SVG using the<code>gradientTransform</code>attribute. This attribute accepts many<code>transform</code>values, including<code>translate()</code>,<code>scale()</code>,<code>rotate()</code>and<code>matrix()</code>. If you’d like to dive deeper, the specification lists<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementGradientTransformAttribute">all of the accepted values</a>.</p><p>The<code>gradientTransform</code>example shows how values can be passed using the<code>transform</code>syntax that you are familiar with.</p><p>The gradient’s motion is accomplished through the use of the GreenSock Animation Platform, which manipulates the attribute. The entire discussion surrounding how to animate the gradient is best left for another time, but the demo provides plenty of clues, should you be curious.</p><h3>Spinning Globe<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#spinning-globe">Link</a></h3><p>A clipping path placed strategically over the globe creates the illusion of a sphere spinning 360 degrees when, in fact, it’s two identical paths. These paths (i.e. the map) are moved along the x axis in tandem. Finally, the entire sequence is repeated. An inline SVG clip path — the ellipse — is used to hide the parts of the map that lie outside the view of the globe.</p><p>Resting in the<code>defs</code>of the SVG is the clipping shape (i.e. ellipse). Directly beneath it is the reference that turns this ellipse into a reusable clipping path. You can also think of it as a reusable symbol.</p><p>The<code>defs</code>element allows graphical objects to be defined for reuse. When possible, define referenced elements inside this element. Defining graphic visuals such as linear gradients and animations inside these elements promotes both<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html">understanding of the SVG content and accessibility</a>.</p><p>Because the clipping path defined in<code>defs</code>has an ID, it can be referred to with the<code>use</code>element to render these graphical effects anywhere. A clipping path is referred to using the<code>clip-path</code>attribute, as follows:</p><p>In this case, the<code>use</code>element is used multiple times, making this technique one of the best parts about SVG. Any graphical elements defined inside<code>defs</code>are not directly rendered and can be saved for reuse at another time. The<code>use</code>element takes nodes from within the SVG document and duplicates them elsewhere.</p><p>I’ve highlighted each part of the SVG where the clipping path occurs. The clip path is an ellipse where the content (in this case, the map of the continents) is clipped into the ellipse shape (the globe). I’ve also included a duplicate map off to the left of the initially visible map, to make this spinning sequence appear as if it is rotating seamlessly.</p><p>To see this effect for yourself, follow the steps detailed in the video above:</p><ol><li>Open Chrome.</li><li>Load the<a href="http://codepen.io/dennisgaebel/pen/aOXJep">Codepen page</a>.</li><li>Right-click on the globe, then select “Inspect Element.”</li><li>In the “Elements” tab of the Developer Tools, find the element<code>id="continents"</code>and expand it.</li><li>For each of the elements<code>id="middle"</code>and<code>id="left"</code>, double-click on the code<code>clip-path="url(#clipPath)"</code>, select it completely, backspace, then enter.</li><li>Now, on the page, watch the two sets of continents move.</li></ol><p>Using the<a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">GreenSock Animation Platform</a>to control the motion and some minor timing adjustments, we can make the globe appear to spin 360 degrees seamlessly.</p><p>If you’ve never heard of it, the GreenSock Animation Platform (called GSAP by avid users) is a suite of tools for scripted animation written in JavaScript.<a href="http://davidwalsh.name/gsap-svg">Sarah Drasner</a>and<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/the-beginners-guide-to-timelinemax--cms-765">Dennis Gaebel</a>each offer a great series on it for the eager beginner.</p><p>If you’re curious how to create a<code>clipPath</code>in Illustrator, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Make a shape with the Marquee or Pen tool.</li><li>Place an object below the shape.</li><li>Right-click the object, and select “Make clipping mask.”</li></ol><h3>Folding Fan<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#folding-fan">Link</a></h3><p>To better understand<code>clipPath</code>, let’s examine this SVG fan by<a href="http://thoughtbot.github.io/foundry">Thoughtbot</a>, who has thoroughly cleaned and customized it by hand and strategically placed<code>clipPath</code>to identify and animate the visible region.</p><p>The diagram helps us to understand the<code>clipPath</code>shape by revealing what remains visible and invisible to the viewer as the folding action takes place. The individual blades don’t fold because the motion is fast enough to fool the eye — the entire section of blades is moved outside the clipping path through the power of rotation. The<code>clipPath</code>is nothing more than a simple polygon shape. Anything that resides within the bounding area is visible to the viewer, and anything outside of this region is invisible.</p><p>The SVG uses a<code>polyline</code>element to create the defining shape. A<code>clipPath</code>is then created around it, defining the bounding region, a square. Finally, the shape is laid over the portion of the artwork where the clipping effect is desired — that is, directly over the fan blades, designated with an ID of<code>fan</code>and referred to by the<code>clip-path</code>attribute.</p><h3>Clips And Paths To Create The Illusion Of A Morph<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#clips-and-paths-to-create-the-illusion-of-a-morph">Link</a></h3><p>In this demo, Chris Gannon animates clipping paths to make paper appear as though it’s being shredded or morphed into another form, although the strips themselves are not created with clip paths. Investigating the HTML panel of this demo, you’ll see that the individual parts of this SVG reside in a single vector file.</p><p>If you’re still asking yourself how this trick is done, the following image illustrates the effect:</p><p>The clipping paths are simply SVG rectangles, nothing more! This means that anything within the boundaries of the defined rectangle will be visible to the viewer, and anything that lies outside of this space will be invisible.</p><p>All that’s left to do is move the bits within these clipping regions along the y axis from top to bottom. Just before the full sheet of paper reaches the end of its sequence, a call is made to the next sequence of the animation, whereupon the paper is chopped up and ejected from the shredder.</p><h3>Clipping Animations With Mouse Events<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#clipping-animations-with-mouse-events">Link</a></h3><p>This demo was posted quite a while back, but it’s worth sharing because it shows another great use of the clip path. It’s also a pretty fun way to combine SVG clips with user interaction. Move your mouse over the girl to see the effect.</p><p>Here is the same concept that we previously saw, but combined with a bit of animation to enhance the effect.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/animating-clipped-elements-svg/#conclusion">Link</a></h3><p>Clip paths open up a wide array of exciting possibilities. Understanding the simple mechanics and how everything moves relative to each other can help you create some powerful and captivating interactions for your users. Try this out with text, imagery, scrolling and more! Have fun, and don’t be scared to take chances.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Animating Clipped Elements In SVG</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
