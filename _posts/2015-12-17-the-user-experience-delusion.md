I am a user experience designer. But you wouldn't recognize me as one. I don't often use Photoshop, Skitch or any other graphics package. You will rarely find me designing hero banners or carousels. I don't even find myself wireframing much these days. Even so, I do design the experiences of users.

I don't sound much like a designer, do I? But then I think we have a narrow view of what a designer is and an even narrower view of user experience.

### User Experience Is More Than A Single User Interface[Link][0]

Can I let you in on one of my pet peeves? It is job descriptions for UX and UI designers. My problem with these job descriptions is that they position user experience design and user interface design as the same thing. They are not.

For a start, the user interface designer is not the only one who influences the user experience. That trivializes the impact that[developers][1], copywriters and others have on the interfaces we build. More importantly, the user's experience isn't constrained by any single interface.

More than ever, users are moving between platforms and devices. That could mean moving from a mobile device to a laptop or from a social media platform to a website --- all while dealing with a single organization. This complex web of platforms and devices works together to shape the user's experience. No single user interface encapsulates the entire user experience. As we will explore later in the post, user experience has many facets, starting at initial brand recognition and going all the way through to long-term customer support.

We are also just beginning to see a decline in the dominance of user interfaces as the primary point of user interaction. A new type of user experience, built around sensors and intelligent software, is starting --- experiences such as those provided by[Disney's MagicBand][2]and apps like[Moves][3], which rarely even needs to be launched.

Even today, much of the user's experience has nothing to do with the interface. That is why, if you are going to call yourself a user experience designer, you need to delve deeper than the pixels.

### Going Deeper With User Experience[Link][4]

One of the most important principles to understand about user experience design is that it does not stop at the edge of the screen. All kinds of things influence the user's experience that have nothing to do with pixels or interfaces.

For a start, there is all of the work carried out by marketers. They have a profound impact on how people perceive an organization going in. This perception influences how users judge the experience they receive. For example, if a marketing campaign positions a brand as a budget option, then users will be more tolerant of a poor experience. Marketing frames our expectations.

It is not just marketing that influences the user experience. In fact, almost every part of an organization has an impact, whether it be how the customer-service team fields calls or how finance charges users.

Even non-customer-facing departments have an impact. We have all endured terms of service produced by a legal department, or gotten frustrated by a lack of information about the dispatch of a product by a fulfilment team.

Getting these teams to put the user at the heart of their processes can be an enormous challenge, especially if they are not customer-facing. Even if management is user-centric, translating that to day-to-day operations is difficult.

For a start,**organizational structure often gets in the way**. Most organizations work in silos. But, as we have seen, creating a great user experience involves working across silos.

Then there are those**standard operating procedures and other forms of governance**--- processes that made sense in the past but have become a barrier in light of the changes digital has brought. These need challenging and replacing with something more relevant.

Finally, there are the unwritten rules of how an organization operates, the**cultural norms**that are often not user-friendly. When seeking to improve the experience of users, it is common to encounter objections --- objections that are nothing more than "That is not how we do things here."

All of this shapes the user experience. Tackling these issues is what user experience design is really about. Yet it is not how many perceive it, including many designers.

### How We Can Redefine User Experience Design[Link][5]

It is time for us to redefine what it means to design a user's experience. That starts with redefining what design is. Too often, we view design as pushing pixels and making interfaces. But as we all know, good design is about so much more. Sometimes an interface is the right answer, sometimes a sensor is. But more often than not, it entails establishing a new process or forming a new team.

At the heart of good user experience design is collaboration. As designers, our job is to bring colleagues together to create better experiences. We cannot do it alone by opening Photoshop. We cannot even do it with a developer or copywriter at our side.

True collaboration means working with people outside of our normal digital teams: marketers, customer-support staff, even people in legal and finance. The truth is that creating a user experience means working with almost everybody across an organization.

But to create that kind of collaborative atmosphere, we need to become educators. We need to educate our colleagues and management about the value of a great user experience. We need to educate them about how, together, we need to address issues such as:

* inconsistency in organizational tone of voice,
* users having to reenter data when forced to deal with different systems,
* users having to repeat themselves when dealing with different departments,
* inconsistent levels of service across different channels and departments,
* contradiction in the information provided by different business silos,
* users falling between the gaps of different organizational processes or policies.

The list could and should go on. Only then can we start to challenge the culture, policies and company structures that are barriers to success.

I once spoke with[Leisa Reichelt][6]about her job as lead user researcher at[Government Digital Service][7]here in the UK. I asked her what exactly her job involves. She said she spends only 30% of her time doing user research and 70% of her time communicating that research to her colleagues.

We think that our job as designers is to "design" interfaces. I believe that is only a small part of it. Our focus should be on educating colleagues and management, educating them about the need to create great experiences and how to achieve that. We need to:

* start arranging user experience meetups and presentations within our organizations to promote best practices,
* publish newsletters internally to showcase better ways of working,
* build prototypes that demonstrate how things could be better,
* invite colleagues to see the consequences of poor user experience in usability sessions,
* share testimonials from frustrated customers,
* produce infographics highlighting analytics related to user experience.

There is no shortage of ways to educate if we have the will to pursue them. But before we can do that, we need to broaden our own view of design and recognize the need for collaboration with all of our colleagues, not just those we consider to be user experience professionals.
